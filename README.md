# First Grade Storytelling Podcast Series

🎧 Welcome to the **First Grade Storytelling Podcast Series** – a creative collection of audio episodes featuring original stories written and narrated by first-grade students.

These episodes were lovingly edited and produced using Adobe Audition. Each `.sesx` project file corresponds to one podcast episode, highlighting the imagination, voice, and personality of each young storyteller.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repository contains 10 podcast session files:

- Each file has a `.sesx` extension (Adobe Audition Session)
- Fully edited and arranged for final mixdown

## ✨ Project Highlights

- 📚 Original short stories by 1st grade students
- 🎙️ Voice recordings edited for clarity and warmth
- 🎶 Background music and sound effects (where applicable)
- 🎧 Ready for export as MP3 or WAV for sharing or distribution

## 🛠️ Requirements

To open or continue editing these sessions:

- **Adobe Audition CC** (or compatible version that supports `.sesx`)
- Associated audio files (stored in a media folder, if used)

> 🎓 Ideal for educational showcases, parent-teacher events, school websites, or storytelling archives.

## 📌 Notes

- These files are project files only; they do not include exported audio.
- For best results, open the `.sesx` files in Adobe Audition with their associated media paths intact.
- Make sure to preserve folder structure if moving the project to another device.
